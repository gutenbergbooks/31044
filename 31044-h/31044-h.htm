<h2>THE TURN OF THE ROAD.</h2>

<h2>SCENE I.</h2>


<p><small>A farm kitchen of the present day. Door at back, opening to yard, and
window with deal table on which are lying dishes and drying cloths
with basin of water. A large crock under table. A dresser with
crockery, etc., stands near to another door which opens into living
rooms. Opposite there is a fireplace with projecting breasts, in which
a turf fire is glowing. Time, about eight of a summer evening in July.
Mrs. Granahan and Ellen are engaged at table washing and drying the
plates after the supper. Thomas Granahan, the grandfather, is seated
at fire place and has evidently just finished his stirabout. The
strains of a quaint folk-air played on a violin, sound faintly from
the inner room.</small></p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Is that the whole of them now Ellen?</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Yes that's all now but one.</p>

<div class="rightquot">She goes across to grandfather and lifts the plate.</div>

<p>Have you finished granda?</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Yes dearie I have done.</p>

<div class="rightquot">He pauses and fumbles for his pipe, &amp;c.</div>

<p>Is'nt that a fiddle I'm hearing?</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Yes. Robbie's playing the fiddle in the low room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Arranging plates on dresser and turning round.</div>

<p>I wish some one would stop that boy's fool nonsense wi' his fiddle. He's
far too fond o' playin'. It would stand him better to mind his work.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Calls.</div>

<p>Robbie!</p>

<div class="rightquot">Louder.</div>

<p>D'you hear me Robbie?</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Oh, let the boy be, mother. Its the first time I've heard him at it this
week.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Och aye. Let the boy enjoy himself. You're only young wanst you know, Mary.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>I think it must be a great thing to be a great musician. Sometimes I
believe Robbie should try his luck with that fiddle of his. Somehow I
know&mdash;I feel he <i>is</i> a genius at it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>What notions you do have to be sure. To think of a big grown man like
Robbie John spending his life-time at an old fiddle.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Sharply.</div>

<p>Blathers and nonsense. Its time that boy was out lookin' at the cattle.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Calls.</div>

<p>Are you there Robbie?</p>

<div class="rightquot">Louder.</div>

<p>Robbie John.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>From without. The fiddle ceases suddenly and he comes and stands with it in
his hand at the door.</p></div>

<p>Aye.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>You'd better go down to the low field and see the cattle haven't broken
through into Aura Boyd's corn. You couldn't keep them beasts in when the
flies gets at them.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Just one second till I try this again.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Now, will you go when I tell you. You and your ould fiddle. It'll be the
death of you yet. Mind what I say.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Coming through door and standing there.</div>

<p>Bad cess to the cattle and Aura Boyd.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>He's a tarr'ble unneighbourly man.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>He's a cross grained man right enough, but it wouldn't do to have the
cattle trampin' and eatin' his corn.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>I was down there only ten minutes ago when you sent me, and they were
eatin' there quite peaceable.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Now will you go Robbie John when your mother wants you. Aura Boyd sent over
here this forenoon to say if that Kerry cow broke into his field again he'd
have the law agin us.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Och, he's a cross ould cratur. Sure, she had only one foot through the
hedge when he turned her.</p>

<div class="rightquot">He sees mother is getting impatient.</div>

<p>All right; I'm away.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He goes back into room, leaves fiddle there, comes into kitchen again and
goes out by door to yard.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>He's as ill to drive as the ould mare to meetin' a Sundays.</p>

<div class="rightquot">She goes and looks through door into room.</div>

<p>Look at the time it is and your father and Samuel James niver back yet
Ellen. They're terrible late o' comin'.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Och, I suppose they've met some dealer at the fair and are driving a hard
bargain as usual.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>I wonner if they got that foal red off their hands yet. It'll be a job I'm
thinkin'. He was a miserable baste, and tarr'ble broken in the wind.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Och, trust father to make that all right. I heard Mr. Taylor, of the
creamery, say that father could sell you skim milk for cream, better than
any man he knew.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Seating herself at chair beside table at back.</div>

<p>Oh, aye. It's easy for <i>him</i> to talk, but money's hard o' makin', and if
people's soft it's their own fault. Only I hope they've no' taken any drink.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>It's no fault in a good man if he does take a half-un.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Now, don't you be startin' to talk that way. It's always the way with them
dailers. Muddle the good man's head with whiskey, and then <i>do</i> him.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Standing nonchalantly at table facing front with hands resting on it.</p></div>

<p>They'll not muddle father much I'm thinkin'. Besides, Samuel James is with
him.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Samuel James is a cunnin' rascal.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Don't you miscall my son Mr. Granahan. He's a canny good son and works
hard, and is worth more than half-a-dozen men like Robbie John. They'll no
put their finger in his eye.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Goes to door back.</div>

<p>Bliss my heart there's that sow among the kale. Shoo!</p>

<div class="rightquot">She goes out and is heard shouting.</div>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Laughing.</div>

<p>That poor sow. It has the times of it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Robbie John enters and sits down near grandfather.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Well, son; what about the cattle?</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Weariedly.</div>

<p>Och, they're all right. I knowed they'd be all right. It's always the way.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Soothingly.</div>

<p>They are a terrible newsance, indeed, Robbie.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>But that's not what troubles me. Why can't mother leave me alone for just a
few minutes till I get some time to myself at the fiddle. I niver touch it
but I'm taken away and sent off somewhere.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Seating herself at chair beside Robbie John.</div>

<p>Don't be cross with her Robbie, dear. She's anxious about the cattle.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>But, Ellen, look here. Any time I can get to have just a tune on that
fiddle, someone's sure to take me away from it. Father sends me out to mend
gaps that were mended, or cut turf that was cut, or fodder horses that were
foddered. And when he's away and I might have some chance, mother does the
same. Here I've been workin' for the past week, day in and day out, and the
very first chance I get, I must run after the cattle or somethin'.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Despondently,</div>

<p>Nobody has any feelin' for me here at all.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Now, now; Robbie. It's all for your own good, son, she does it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>And we feel for him, don't we Grand-da? You mustn't look so cross, Robbie.
You know that they think you're too much wrapped up in that fiddle of
yours, and they want to break you off it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Determinedly.</div>

<p>That they never will; never.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Coaxingly.</div>

<p>Oh! look grandfather at the cross Robbie.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Gazing amusedly at Robbie John.</div>

<p>Indeed, Robbie, you look like them prize fightin' men ye see up in the
town.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Well, there; is that any better.</p>

<div class="rightquot">He smiles half bitterly.</div>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>A wee bit. I wish Jennie Graeme seen you with that face. You wouldn't get
your arm round her so easy then; would he Grand-da?</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>A bonny wee girl she is, and has a fine farm and land comin' till her.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Aside.</div>

<p>Boys a dear but these musicians gets the fine weemin.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>There, there; and creamery managers sometimes gets them too, Grand-da.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Indeed, that Taylor man will get a body can cook sowans anyway.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Looking through window.</div>

<p>Here's mother.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Enters and sits down exhausted on chair at side of table next door.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>That sows a torment. I just had her out and back she doubles again.
She just has me fair out of wind turnin' her out.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Rising and making toward door into room.</div>

<p>I can go and have some practisin' now.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Robbie John, I seen the carts comin' up the loanin'. Your father will
be in, in no time. He'll no be pleased to see you han'lin' that,</p>

<div class="rightquot">pointing to the fiddle.</div>

<p>just when he comes back.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Starts up as if suddenly reminded.</div>

<p>I must go and get them eggs counted.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Goes out again through door to yard.</div>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Aye, Robbie; don't take it. He'll just think you've been playin' that
all the time he was away. And he's always that cross after markets,
you couldn't stand him.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Sitting down again.</div>

<p>You're right. I don't want another talkin' to like the last one; but
its hard.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He takes up a stick from fuel beside fireplace
and starts whittling it. The rattle of carts is heard. Samuel James
passes the window and walks in. He is partially intoxicated, enough only to
make him talkative.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Well, how did the fair go off?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Samuel James takes off his overcoat,
flings it on back of chair beside dresser and sits down heavily.</p></div>

<p>Ah! you've been takin' a drop, as usual.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Scowls at this but does not deny.</div>

<p>The fair. Oh, it was great value. Sure grand-da he sould
the foal for thirty poun'.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Astonished</div>

<p>Boys a dear but William John Granahan bates the divil. And who took her?</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>There was a cavalryman bought her. Boys but Da is the hard man to plaze. We
stopped at Muc Alanan's on the way home and met William John McKillop
there, and he toul' the oul' man he was a fool to let a good horse go at
that price, for he was lookin' all roads to give him thirty poun' for it;
only he couldn't get in time for the sale.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Incredulously.</div>

<p>Who did you say? McKillop?</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Laughing.</div>

<p>Aye.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Smiling.</div>

<p>Sure McKillop hasn't two sov'rins in the wide world. He was only takin' a
rise out of Da.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Sure I knowed the ould Yahoo hadn't the price of a nanny-goat. But of
course, Da tuk it all in for gospel. And me sittin' listenin to him tellin'
ould McKillop what a grand action the foal had and the shoulders the baste
had, and the way it could draw thirty hundred up Killainey hill without a
pech.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Astonished.</div>

<p>William John Granahan makes a tarr'ble fine Sunday School teacher.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Grinning.</div>

<p>But to see ould McKillop sittin' there as solemn as a judge, drinkin' it
all in as if gospel and winkin' at me on the sly, the ould rascal, and
cursin' his luck at losin' such a bargain.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The voice of William John Granahan can be heard inviting some one to come
on. The strains of a fiddle played by uncertain but unmistakeably
professional hands, sounds from the same direction.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Looking out through window into yard.</div>

<p>Who's that father has got with him Samuel James? Oh such a dirty looking
man!</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Chuckling.</div>

<p>Da got ahoult of him at Buckna cross roads and right or wrong he'd have him
home wi' him to show Robbie John what fiddlin' brings a man till.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Severely.</div>

<p>Its my mind that you and father have been stayin' too long in the public
house, Samuel James.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>William John Granahan and tramp fiddler can be seen outside window.</p></div>

<p>Look at them&mdash;comin' in! oh my; wait till mother sees the pair of
them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>William John Granahan comes in leading a ragged looking bearded tramp with
an old fiddle tucked under his arm.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Now we're hame, and we'll get a drop to drink and a bite to eat, Mr.
Fiddler.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He goes over to fireplace and stands with his back to the fire.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Take a sate at the fire and warm yourself.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No one offers a seat to the tramp who stands puzzled looking and swaying in
a drunken manner in the kitchen, slightly in front of Samuel James, who
remains seated beside dresser engaged in taking off his leggings.</p></div>

<p>Ellen. Get us a drop o' tay and give this poor misguided cratur somethin'
to eat.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Moves over to dresser and then stands at door into room. She evidently
disapproves of the tramp and does not offer to obey. The grandfather rises
in disgust and moves his chair nearer the fireplace away from the tramp.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">Tramp.</div>

<div class="rightquot">To Ellen.</div>

<p>Your pardon noble lady, I intrude. Your pardon signor I incommode you.
Times change and so do men. Ladies and gentlemen behold in me the one time
famous leader of the Blue Bohemian Wind and String Band that had the honour
of appearing before all the crowned heads of Europe.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>God bless me, d'you say so mister? D'ye hear that Robbie John. There's a
fiddler for you and see what comes of it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Tramp.</div>

<p>Perhaps with your permission I may venture to play you a few extracts from
my repertoire. I can play to suit all tastes from a simple country ballad
to a concerto by Brahms or the great Russian composer Tschaikouski.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Openmouthed.</div>

<p>Them Rooshians has the tarr'ble names!</p>

<div class="pchar">Tramp.</div>

<p>Firstly I shall play that touching little ballad I heard Monsieur here
warble so sweetly as we rolled homeward on his chariot. If I play he
accompanies me with voice. Ne'st ce pas, Monsieur?</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Nervously.</div>

<p>Is your mother out Ellen?</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>She's lookin' after the hens I think. She won't hear you.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>William John Granahan starts singing two verses of a folk song, the tramp
accompanying meanwhile with fiddle, always putting in an extra flourish.
The rest all join, even the grandfather beats time with a stick. The door
opens and Mrs. Granahan appears seemingly astonished at the uproar. All
suddenly cease singing and try to appear innocent, except the tramp, who
goes on playing. He suddenly notices the cessation.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">Tramp.</div>

<p>Bravo. A most exquisite little air and beautifully rendered.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He stops short on seeing Mrs. Granahan who stands glaring at him arms
akimbo.</p></div>

<p>Your pardon madam. You are the mistress I take it of this most noble and
hospitable house.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Ignoring him and going to centre of floor where she looks angrily at
William John Granahan who endeavours to appear unconcerned.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>You should be well ashamed of yourself William John Granahan. What will
they say about you in the Session I wonner next Sabbath day. D'you think my
house is a home for all the dirt and scum of the country side?</p>

<div class="pchar">Tramp.</div>

<p>Your pardon madam. You owe me an apology. Appearances belie me but scum I
am not. I was at one time the well known and justly famous leader of the
Blue Bohemian Wind and String&mdash;</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Wind and string fiddlesticks. Out you go. Out you will go. I want no tramps
in here upsettin' my house and makin' it the talk of the neighbours. Out
you go at once.</p>

<div class="pchar">Tramp.</div>

<div class="rightquot">With drunken pride.</div>

<p>I thrust my company on no man or woman uninvited.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Out you go. I want no excuses. Put him out of this Samuel James.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Samuel James eludes his mother's eye and beckons the tramp to stay on.</p></div>

<p>The drunken wretch comin' in here. A nice place you'd have it William
Granahan with your fine company.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>I brought him home here as a tarr'ble and awful warnin' to Robbie John what
this sort of an occupation brings a man till. Yon see him Robbie John.
There's you're great fiddlin' for you. Be warned in time.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The tramp moves to the door. Robbie John rises and goes across to him and
taps him on the shoulder.</p></div>

<p>Here.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Slips him money.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>God bless you poor wanderin' soul and God forbid any Granahan should ever
be treated as you have been.</p>

<div class="pchar">Tramp.</div>

<p>Sir, I thank you.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Coming back to him and confidentially.</div>

<p>Perhaps I could yet please your ears with a romanza which I composed
myself&mdash;</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Away with you out of this. We want none of your music here.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="centerquot">To tramp.</div>

<p>Why don't you give up playin' that fiddle of yours and turn your hand to
honest work?</p>

<div class="pchar">Tramp.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Proudly.</div>

<p>Desert my fiddle. The fiddle presented to me at Vienna by my orchestra! A
genuine old Cremona 200 years old! Rather would I wander in Hades for ever.
Never! Though cruel words stab and wound me.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Half sobbing.</div>

<p>Farewell.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>All remain quiet. The strains of a melancholy air like a serenade come from
outside. It slowly dies away in the distance. Robbie John moves forward as
if to go out.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Sharply.</div>

<p>Robbie John. Where are you going? Don't dare to leave the house. My son
going out to keep company with the likes of that dirty rapscallion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Ah mother pity the poor wretch. Every word you said to him cut and wounded
me to the quick. Did you not see the tears in his eyes for all his fine
talk. I should like to know more about him.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>If you went to the sergeant at the barrack, I warrant ye he could tell you
more about him.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He bends down as if to catch the sound of the fiddling which grows very
faint.</p></div>

<p>Listen!</p>

<div class="rightquot">Robbie John moves to door and opens it.</div>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Angrily.</div>

<p>Where are you going?</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Rapt.</div>

<p>Listen.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He holds his hand for silence. Then quickly goes out.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">To get into his wife's good graces.</div>

<p>Well Mary the foal's sould at last.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>I've a crow to pluck wi' you over that same foal, William Granahan. I
suppose they did you as usual.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Getting angry.</div>

<p>Nine and thirty year ha'e I gone till market and no man, woman, child, dog
or divil ever got the better of me in a bargain yet and right well you know
it.</p>

<div class="rightquot">With pride.</div>

<p>I soul' the foal for thirty poun' not a ha'penny less.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Doubtfully.</div>

<p>I hope you ha'e it all wi' you.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>I ha'e it all but two shillin' and wan penny.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>And can you account for them?</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Woman dear would you ha'e me go and come to market wi'out a ha'penny in my
pocket? Have some gumption about ye.</p>

<div class="rightquot">In a loud angry voice.</div>

<p>I'm danged but the next time I make a good bargain, I'll go and ha'e a week
to myself in Newcastle or Belfast. I'm young enow yet.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>There. Stop your fool talk in front of the children and go and change your
clothes.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>It was a good price indeed.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Slily.</div>

<p>Yes. He soul' it for thirty poun' and William John McKillop lookin' all
roads to give him forty for it.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Angrily and stamping his foot.</div>

<p>Will you houl' your tongue you blatterin' blatherin' idiot. Bad scran to ye
for a meddle&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He goes forward to go into room and aims a box on the ears at Samuel James
who retreats to table and watches him go through door followed by Mrs.
Granahan. A noise of voices in angry argument is heard.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Now he'll catch it. If I had been Da I would ha'e kept back five poun' and
toul' her I soul' it for twenty-five, but the ould man's that honest, he
knows no better.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Robbie John enters. He goes to seat himself in his old position but stops a
moment when spoken to, and then in a petulant manner takes his seat on
hearing the speech.</p></div>

<p>Well Robbie and what d'ye think of his great object lesson till ye. It was
me put it intil Da's head. I thought there might be a bit o' value.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Chuckles.</div>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>There. I just thought it was you did it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>She comes and sits down again beside table at left. Samuel James seats
himself on table carelessly and swings his legs under.</p></div>

<p>You're a schemer that's what you are.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Aye. There's a dale of the crook in ye Samuel James. You're deeper nor one
would think.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Suddenly to Robbie John.</div>

<p>I seen Jenny Graeme at the market to-day Robbie.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Robbie John does not answer, being evidently shy.</p></div>

<p>Oh well, maybe you're no interested in her.</p>

<div class="rightquot">To Ellen.</div>

<p>Man there was a fine lock o' cattle at the fair, Ellen.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>I'm sure there was. Who else did you see?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Unwillingly but unable to restrain his jealousy.</div>

<p>Who was with her? Who left her home?</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Nodding slily to Ellen.</div>

<p>Young M'Donnell o' the Hill head was looking after her pretty close.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Glancing at Robbie and then at Samuel James and smiling.</p></div>

<p>He's a very nice young man.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Savagely.</div>

<p>I wish her luck wi' yon booby.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>There's nothin' the matter wi' him. He has a nice place and a fine farm
forbye.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Farms and cattle and crops don't make a fine man.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Deed now Robbie, they goes a long ways.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="rightquot">To himself.</div>

<p>Better nor bows and fiddles and such trash.</p>

<div class="rightquot">To Robbie John.</div>

<p>I heerd up at Bann to-day, that ye won three poun' at the Feis at Newcastle
a Monday.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>I knew that on Tuesday. It was fine of Robbie wasn't it?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>It all depends. Da heard it for the first time to-day and I can tell you it
didn't seem fine to him. Coorse a poun' or two would ha'e made a differ o'
opinion same as it done wi' you I expect.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>You needn't sneer at me. It was me told Robbie to keep it. He was goin' to
give it all up. I wouldn't be so mean as to take it off him.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Oh you're an unusual sort of young woman I know but if Robbie John takes my
advice, he better choose quick between playin' the fiddle and stayin' on
here.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Give up my fiddle. Never.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Well you can plaze yourself. I suppose you could make as much by fiddlin'
as if you stayed on here and waited till we had the place divid among the
three of us.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Why I heard from Mr. Taylor that father was worth four or five hundred
pounds and then the two farms.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Aye. You'd be a long time Robbie John earnin' that wi' your fiddle. Don't
heed his fool talk son. Stay at home and nivir mind the musicians.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Robbie dear, and I'm sure Mr. Graeme would never let his daughter marry a
penniless fiddler&mdash;even if she would herself. I don't know. She might
and she&mdash;mightn't.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Rising from table and stretching himself.</div>

<p>Coorse if he made a name for himself he could marry the landlord's
daughter. I heerd the quality go mad after the musicianers.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Makes to door.</div>

<p>Well I'm going to wash my hands.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Goes out to yard.</div>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Robbie dear. Come here.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Aye. What is it?</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Take heed till yourself. I know what's going on better nor you. Take an
ould man's advice. Settle yourself down and give up that string instrument.
Coorse I daresay you may go and become a great man wi' it but you're more
like to become a cratur like thon that was in as not. There's no good
runnin' risks. And your father, I heerd him say himself, if you make your
bed, you'll lie on it, for he'll nivir help you out, once you take to the
fiddlin'.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Aye Robbie. Its far better not to run the risk of becoming a beggar man.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Well I'll think over it Ellen. I'll think over it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Robbie, come out wi' me.</p>

<div class="rightquot">The two go out by door into yard.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>William John and Mrs. Granahan come in arguing excitedly.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Well you can ha'e the poun' if you like, but I can tell you its a sore
pinch to make things do, what with the price of the sugar riz up and the
flour.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Samuel James comes in. He takes in the situation and seats himself again on
the table near Ellen who remains still seated beside it.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>There. That's enough to do about it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He goes over to armchair but does not sit down and remains facing Mrs.
Granahan.</p></div>

<p>Twenty nine poun' you'll get and no more.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Emphatically.</div>

<p>Min' that.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>I'll min' it right enough William Granahan. And its a sore time I have
trying to keep in wi' one hand what you lavish out wi' the other.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Nudging Ellen slily.</div>

<p>I was talking by the way to Mrs. McCrum the milliner, mother, to-day, and
she said to give you word she'd have your new tay gown ready for you a
Tuesday week.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Triumphantly.</div>

<p>There you are ma'am. There you are. Keepin' it in wi' one hand were you?
Faith if I know anything you lather it out wi both hands and feet. You want
to rob me of me one poun' do ye? And all for an ould tay gown!</p>

<div class="rightquot">Contemptuously.</div>

<p>A tay gown!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Maliciously.</div>

<p>A taygown's not expensive.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Oh indeed now? Hach. You'll be wantin' one next I suppose. A nice house
this is, where a man couldn't get keepin' as much as would buy him an ounce
o' tobaccy.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Viciously.</div>

<p>Man I do hate this hypockerisy.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>I'll not talk any more till ye, William Granahan. You're full o' drink and
bad tongued.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>If you say any more till me, I'll smash all the crockery in the house.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Come out Ellen to the creamery and maybe when we come in, he'll be a bit
cooler in the head.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>She hurries out followed by Ellen through door to yard.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">To Samuel James.</div>

<p>She's a tarr'ble woman your mother when she's started. But I'm much obliged
to you Samuel James for the mention o' that tay gown. By me sang, but that
turned the enemy's flank.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Laughs.</div>

<p>I'm danged but you're the boy.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Gratefully.</div>

<p>Heth you saved me a poun' anyway.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Rising and going over sheepishly to him.</div>

<p>You'll not forget me Da? will you?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Suspiciously.</div>

<p>Na.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Well ye might gie us a part o' it.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>How much dy'e want?</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Twelve shillin'.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Would you take the very boots off me feet. Where would I get ye twelve
shillin'.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Out o' the poun' o' coorse. Where else?</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Grumblingly.</div>

<p>You're askin' ower much. If it was a saxpence</p>

<div class="rightquot">Samuel James shrugs his shoulders.</div>

<p>or a shillin'</p>

<div class="rightquot">Samuel James shrugs more emphatically.</div>

<p>or two shillin'?</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>No.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>or half a crown?</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>No.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>I'd think nothing of lendin' them till ye. But twelve shillin'! Would three
shillin' no' do?</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>No. It won't. Either give me the twelve shillin' or I'll tell her about
your conduck&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>There. There it is an bad scran to ye. To think o' me walkin' ten mile to
the fair and back and arguin' wi' dailers and chates of all kinds and
gettin thirty poun' for a baste I wouldn't buy myself for thirty shillin'
and only gettin' eight shillin' out o' it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Whistling and counting money delightedly.</div>

<p>Aye. Its a hard world and no mistake.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Excitedly.</div>

<p>I'll go down to the shough and drown myself I will.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Na. Go to MucAlanan's and drown yerself.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>I'm danged but you're right. Na. Na. She'll hear me goin' out by the gate.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Boys but you're the poor hearted man. Well I'm away.</p>

<div class="rightquot">He makes to door.</div>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Where now?</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>To Courdy Williamson's for the loan of a monkey wrinch for the new machine.
The hay's for cuttin' the morrow.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Oh aye. An you'll be for coortin' that young imp of a daughter o' his I
warrant ye. Were you there yisterday forenoon?</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Somewhat taken aback.</div>

<p>Yis. Why d'ye ask?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Oh nothin'. Only I hadn't a sowl to help me wi' them cattle.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Well wasn't Robbie John at home? What ailed him he couldn't help ye?</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Look you here Samuel James.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Samuel James comes back nearer.</div>

<p>I've been worried wi' that boy this long time.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Samuel James nods approvingly.</div>

<p>I've made up my mind to-day after seein' yon scarecrow we met at Buckna
cross roads, Robbie John aither mends himself or he goes out o' this.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>You're right Da. You hae stud his goings on a long time. I think ye do well
to stop him. It's only doin' him a kindness.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>I'll just ask him to burn it when he comes in. If he won't, he can just
plaze himself. I'll hae no more to do wi' him.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Suddenly.</div>

<p>I wunner what his mother would say to that?</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>She' just as tired of it as you are. Wait; I'll call her in.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Goes to door back and shouts.</div>

<p>Are you there ma'am?</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Without.</div>

<p>Aye.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>She comes to door, opens it and stands looking inquiringly at both of them.</p></div>

<p>Well?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Da's just been talkin' about Robbie John, and he wants you to hear what he
says.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Robbie John's an idle useless paghle. He'll aither mend himself or go out
o' this.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Sharply.</div>

<p>Mend yourself first, me good man.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Its not like as if he tuk a drop o' drink or fell in wi' bad company, for
you'll get quet o' drink and bad company if you hae no money.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Slily.</div>

<p>It was mother and I larnt you that.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Snappishly.</div>

<p>Will you hould your tongue.</p>

<div class="rightquot">To Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>When he might ha' been lookin after the cattle or the pigs or somethin
else, where is he? Up in the loft playin that damnation fiddle o' his.
Night an mornin' he's at it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Deed and he's doin badly by it and no mistake. He's not been worth a ha'
penny till us, this last six months. I think you do right just to stop him.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>I heerd he won three poun' at the Feis last Monday at Newcastle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>There you are. And he never offered me one ha'penny o' it. Me that brought
him up and raired and fed him. Them that plays the fiddle comes to no good
end, I can tell ye.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Reminiscently and with a sort of shame-faced pride.</p></div>

<p>Not but I wasn't the great man at it myself wanst. And you were the girl
that could ha' danced to it Mary. But thank God I quet it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Curiously.</div>

<p>Why?</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>I might ha took to drink and bad company and the like.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>You're no rid o' that yet William Granahan. Ye mind what way ye come home
last Bann Fair on top o' the bread cart.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Slily.</div>

<p>Yis. And the way the Scarva man done him out o' the price o' the two pigs.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>That's one thing I can't get over. Was it in a public house ye met him?</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>There. There. Thats enough to do about it. I hear enough about drinkin'
from John Graeme every session day without you etarnally at it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Robbie John and Grandfather enter. They evidently understand from the looks
of those present that something important is talked of.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Where's that fiddle of yours Robbie John? Bring it to me.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Robbie John looks curiously at him and then at Samuel James. He goes into
room and brings it out. He holds it in his hands and looks suspiciously at
the father.</p></div>

<p>Now Robbie John listen to what I and your mother have thought about this.
For our sake and your own we want you to give up that accursed thing and
put it from you.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Why? What harm does it do you or me?</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>It makes you negleck your work. It makes you think o' things you shouldn't
think o'. It makes you loss slape o' nights sitting up an playin' and then
you can't rise in the mornin'. When you should be polissin the harness, or
mendin' a ditch, or watchin' the cattle, or feedin' the poultry, you've got
this thing in your hand and practisin' on it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Indignantly.</div>

<p>Its not true. I don't do these things. I&mdash;</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Now will you atten' to your duties and give up this playin'. What good will
it ever do ye? Ye seen what it brought yon man till that was in here. It's
a tarrible warnin' till ye.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>The fiddle didn't make him what he is. The drink did that.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Scornfully.</div>

<p>Aye. The leader of an ould circus band or somethin' like.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Getting excited.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>I'd just do wi that as I'd do with a sarpint. Trample it under my heels.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Threateningly.</div>

<p>Dare to put a hand on it. I'll kill the first man tries to.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Angrily.</div>

<p>You dar' talk that way to your father!</p>

<div class="rightquot">Soothingly.</div>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Now Robbie dear. Don't be gettin' on that way.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Robbie my son mind what I was tellin' ye. Its better to bear it if you can
my son. Its a hard thing but you can take my word for it, you'll no regret
it.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Sadly.</div>

<p>I had o' coorse a will drawn up and signed by 'torney McAllan and was for
lavin' ye nice an' comfortable when I was to be takin' away.</p>

<div class="rightquot">He breaks down.</div>

<p>Robbie, Robbie, my son, sure its not my heart you're for breakin'.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Coorse I heerd from one o' the judges, Robbie, at the Feis that you had the
touch o' a master, and all that sort o' thing; but I advise ye&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Here the grandfather shakes his stick at him threateningly.</p></div>

<p>I advise ye&mdash;of coorse its hard to know.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Looking angrily at Samuel James.</div>

<p>Don't think o' that Robbie. Sure every man that plays a fiddle, thinks he's
a genius. Don't be led astray son.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Coaxingly.</div>

<p>Aye. Your grand-da has sense wi' him Robbie. After all what about it. Man
there's that bonny wee lass waitin' for you over at Graemes. To the fire
wi' it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Robbie John hesitates. The grandfather pats him approvingly. With bowed
head he goes forward to place it on the fire.</p><br /><br /></div>

<h2>SCENE II.</h2>


<p><small>The same scene. Ellen and Mrs. Granahan seated near fire.</small></p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>So Mr. Graeme is comin' over here to settle matters with father to-day do
you say?</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Yes child, he's comin' to-day.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>What is it all about?</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Well I suppose he's anxious to see what money is comin' to Robbie John. He
doesn't want to throw his daughter away without askin' questions. I expeck
she's well enough to do to marry anyone she likes, but he's a canny man.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Well I suppose he's right. He must be anxious to see her well married.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Oh now between the two of them, Robbie John will be a sight better off, nor
your father and I, Ellen when we married.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Robbie's a lucky man too. I never seen anyone as fond of him as she is. I
wonner when father will be goin' to see anyone about me?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Oh whist child, your time's comin'. Who was it left ye home from John
Graeme's temperance lecture?</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Slily.</div>

<p>That's a secret.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Knowingly.</div>

<p>Not till me. He's a brave body anyway.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Who?</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Now you're the soft lassie. Who's the manager of the creamery up beyont?</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Unsuspectingly,</div>

<p>Tom Taylor of course.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>And of coorse it was Tom Taylor left ye home.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Knock at the door.</div>

<p>Come in. Come in.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Taylor enters.</div>

<p>Why speak o' the divil&mdash;how d'ye do Mr. Taylor.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He comes in, stands rather awkwardly looking at Ellen, and then goes over
near them.</p></div>

<p>Very well, thank you, ma'am.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>This is my daughter Ellen.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Slily.</div>

<p>I think ye met her afore.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Shaking hands with Ellen, he detains her hand for a second and then drops
it.</p></div>

<p>We did, I think, didn't we?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Knowingly.</div>

<p>I just thought as much.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Aside.</div>

<p>Oh well, he's a brave body and would do rightly if the creamery does the
same.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Suddenly to Taylor.</div>

<p>Are ye coortin' any this weather Mr. Taylor?</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Taken aback. Then decides to laugh it off.</div>

<p>Well&mdash;eh&mdash;no. I'm not doin' much that way.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Incredulously.</div>

<p>Oh indeed. Well I heerd otherwise. Its full time ye were lookin' about for
a wife. You'll be gettin' well on past thirty soon.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Fidgeting uneasily.</div>

<p>Oh I'm time enough for a couple of years or more. I want to look round me a
bit.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Well ye better look sharp, for you'll soon be getting too ould for gettin'
any sort of a dasint girl.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Inquisitively.</div>

<p>Ha'e ye anyone in your eye yet?</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>I have an account to pay your good man Mrs. Granahan.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Two poun' ten is due.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Thinking.</div>

<p>Aye. But I suppose you'll be now in what I would call a good way o' doin'.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>There was a five per cent. dividend this half year. The creamery's goin' on
well.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Searching in pocket and getting out account.</div>

<p>Two pounds, nine and six, ma'am, beggin' your pardon.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Ach sure sixpence is naither here nor there to a creamery.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Pauses.</div>

<p>If that's the way you are, you could be married in a year's time and&mdash;</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Evidently desirous to lead conversation off this topic.</p></div>

<p>Here's the money, ma'am.</p>

<div class="rightquot">He lays it down on the table and counts it out.</div>

<p>You'll do as well as Mr. Granahan, I suppose. You take all to do with the
money part I think.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Yes I do. You were at the lecture last Monday?</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Alarmed.</div>

<p>What the divil&mdash;</p>

<div class="rightquot">Suddenly to Mrs. Granahan and genially.</div>

<p>Yes. Could you oblige me with a receipt ma'am?</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Surely. Here Ellen, get me the pen and ink.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Ellen goes into room.</div>

<p>I suppose now there were some nice young weemin there&mdash;eh Mr. Taylor?</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Uneasily.</div>

<p>Yes. And don't forget the stamp ma'am.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Ach sure a penny stamp's what you always carry wi' ye.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Confidentially.</div>

<p>I think shame on ye Mr. Taylor, triflin' wi' the poor girls. There's no
excuse for a man o' your age.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Fidgeting.</div>

<p>Well, well, I&mdash;Here's a stamp ma'am.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Impatiently.</div>

<p>I'm young enough yet. I don't want to marry yet awhile.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Well now I think ye'd be better o' some one to look after ye. There's
William John Granahan. <i>He's</i> niver done bein' thankful since he married.
He says he doesn't know what he mightn't ha' been, if he hadn't married
<i>me</i>.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Slily.</div>

<p>I can quite believe <i>that</i>.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>It was a good job for him, I can tell ye. For what wi' goin' to dances and
the like and public houses, he was for making a nice mess o' himself.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Confidentially.</div>

<p>And between you and me, Ellen will no' be so badly off aither when he goes.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Ellen comes in and puts paper, &amp;c. on table.</div>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>Here's the stamp ma'am.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Not noticing.</div>

<p>And there's a girl for you Mr. Taylor, that we spent a dale o' time over,
and was brought up most careful. She's none o' your or'nary girls.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Sharply.</div>

<p>Oh mother!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>She looks at Taylor, smiles, and shrugs her shoulders.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Motioning silence.</div>

<p>There's too many girls runnin' about and all they can do is&mdash;sing a
song or two, and dress themselves up like play actresses, and run about at
bazaars and the like trying to get ahoult o' young men.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>You're quite right ma'am.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Now there's Ellen was four years at a boardin' school that Mr. Graeme
recommended till us, and I can tell you she got the proper schoolin', and
let alone that, she can bake, sew or knit, and knows all about the managin'
of a house.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Oh quit!</p>

<div class="rightquot">She looks diffidently across at Taylor, who grins.</div>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Counting money.</div>

<p>Here. It's sixpence short o' the count.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>Let me see.</p>

<div class="rightquot">He goes to table and counts money.</div>

<p>Two and two's four, and two's six, and two and six is eight and six, and
one shillin'&mdash;nine and six.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Thinking.</div>

<p>Nine and six. I thought it was&mdash;oh yes it <i>was</i> nine and six.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>Yes. Nine and six.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Very good. I'll write you a receip'.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Takes pen and paper.</div>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<div class="rightquot">To Taylor who stands looking over at her.</div>

<p>You haven't been round this way a long time Mr. Taylor. What ailed you, you
didn't call?</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>Oh I was very busy.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He looks at Mrs. Granahan who is writing laboriously. Then goes and
examines a fiddle that hangs on the wall.</p></div>

<p>Ha! I thought Robbie John had burnt his fiddle and promised to play no
more.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Aye so he did, but there's a strange story wi' that thing you're lookin'
at. There was a tramp come here one day I was out, and when I come back, I
found him playin' away on that thing, and the house in an uproar.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>Aye? He left it here then?</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>No, wait till I tell ye. I packed him out o' this, and the next thing I
heerd about him was when a wheen o' weeks ago he was got half dead wi' wet
and could in the Flough Moss. John McKillop was down for cutting turf, and
foun' him in a peat hole, wi' his hands on the brew, and the ould fiddle
beside him.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Yes. The poor soul died the next day, and just before he died he asked
McKillop to bring over his fiddle to give to Robbie John. Robbie had been
kind to him sometime or other, and the poor bein' never forgot it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>Ach aye. I do remember hearin' somethin' about it. They said he had been a
big man in his day I think.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Aye. He was blatherin the day he was here about bein' the leader of an ould
band or somethin' like, now that I call to mind. But indeed I paid no heed
till him, for he was part drunk.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Curiously.</div>

<p>You didn't get Robbie to burn this one I see.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Well you see, Samuel James said it was a very valuable one and worth fifty
poun' or more may be. There's an inscription on it somewhere if you look.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Taking down fiddle and examining it.</div>

<p>Aye so I see. "To Nicholas Werner as a token of esteem from his orchestra.
Vienna, 1878."</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Yes poor soul. He was tellin' the truth and no one believin'.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>And does Robbie never play it?</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Not since he promised that I know of. But all the same it must tempt him
for I see his eyes fixed on it often enough when he thinks no one's
lookin'.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He looks over at Mrs. Granahan who appears to be engrossed in her writing.
He is just slipping his arm round Ellen when Mrs. Granahan looks up. He
instantly drops his arm.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Ha'e you that stamp Mr. Taylor?</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>Its usual Mrs. Granahan for whoever signs the receipt to supply the stamp,
however, there you are.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mrs. Granahan licks the stamp, and signs the receipt.</p></div>

<p>The writin' doesn't come easy to you, ma'am.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Now its not very courteous makin' fun o' poor old weemin', Mr. Taylor. I
thought better o' you nor that.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>Ould weemin'? Talk sense, Mrs. Granahan. I only wish my ould woman, if ever
I have one, looks as well as you do.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>There, there, none o' your fool nonsense. You don't go blarneyin' me, like
you do the likes of Ellen there.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Ach mother!</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>I'm much obledged to ye for the money Mr. Taylor. I must put it by me.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Goes into room.</div>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>I suppose you've heard about Robbie?</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Coming near her.</div>

<p>No. What's happened?</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>He's to be married to Jane Graeme at Christmas and Mr. Graeme's comin' over
here to-day to settle about the money.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Slily.</div>

<p>I wonder who your father will be settlin' matters with Ellen, when you get
engaged.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>Why, of course&mdash;whoever gets me, I suppose.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>Well there's one thing I wouldn't haggle with him over.</p>

<div class="pchar">Ellen.</div>

<p>And what would that be?</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>Yourself of course.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He draws her to him and makes to kiss her. Robbie John and Samuel James
pass by the window and Ellen immediately slips away from him. When they
come in, she lifts a can and goes out by door to yard. Robbie John and
Samuel James seat themselves at table.</p>

<p>Leaning against table and nodding to both.</p></div>

<p>Well how's the corn doin'?</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Oh, fairly well the year. How's the crame market?</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>Much the same. Nothin' new with you I suppose?</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Well they're goin' to settle Robbie the day, that's all. He's a lucky boy.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>I wish you joy, Robbie.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Thank ye. Thank ye kindly. She's a nice wee girl.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>You don't seem as gay hearted as I would expect, does he Mr. Taylor? You'd
think he was for getting hung or somethin'. I suppose ye heerd all about
him givin' up the fiddle playin'? And the luck o' it. To burn his ould
fiddle, and then get another a few days after. You'd think there was some
sort of a strange warnin' or advice or somethin' in it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>It is very strange.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Samuel James do ye remember the time that ould tramp was playin' on this
fiddle, as he went out that day, down the loney?</p>

<div class="rightquot">Samuel James nods.</div>

<p>Well, it seemed to me as if he were playin' to bring me out after him. D'ye
mind the story, Mr. Taylor, about the piper that went off with all the
children, and was niver heard tell of again.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>Aye.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Well I could feel him drawin' me out after him the very same way. And last
night, as sure as death, I heard the same uncanny air singin' in my ears,
and it seemed to be callin' me to come out o' this.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Exchanges startled looks with Samuel James.</div>

<p>Och I suppose the wind or somethin' outside. But there's no doubt
Robbie you have a genius for the fiddle. There was a German professor
of music at Newcastle the day you won the prize and he was&mdash;But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
its not right of me to make you vexed, now you've stopped playin'.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Ach he doesn't mind you tellin'. Do ye Robbie? Tell and hearten him up a
wee bit.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>This German was so struck with your playin' that he was lookin' for you all
roads, but you were nowhere to be found.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Interested.</div>

<p>Aye? I went straight home. I wonner what he wanted?</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Perhaps he could have given him a lift, eh Mr. Taylor?</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>He was talkin' to me afterwards and by the way, I had clean forgot.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Fumbling in his pocket.</div>

<p>He gave me his card to give you. I have it on me somewhere I think.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Producing it.</div>

<p>Aye, there it is.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Reading.</div>

<p>Professor&mdash;somethin' or other Royal College of Music.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Keep it. If I had it, it would only temp' me.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Looking significantly at Samuel James who indicates by shaking his head
that he considers Robbie John hopeless.</p></div>

<p>You're a queer character. All right. But you can have it any time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<div class="rightquot">To Samuel James.</div>

<p>I wish I had said nothin' about it. Where's the old man?</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>The two ould men are out in the haggard, but</p>

<div class="rightquot">Slily.</div>

<p>Ellen's in the crame-house.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Taylor goes out through door at back. Samuel James looks over at Robbie
John who sits deep in thought near the fire.</p></div>

<p>You can no' hoodwink me, Robbie. You're no' happy.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>I'm happy enough.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Angrily.</div>

<p>Don't be tormentin' me.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Faith you look happy.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Drawing closer.</div>

<p>I seen you last night at it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Looks round startled.</div>

<p>I couldn't keep from it. There's a spell or somethin' on it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Na. Na. But every fiddle has its spell for you. You broke your promise.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>You followed me then?</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Yes. Ye crept on your stocking soles to the back o' the forth ditch, and
played there for two mortal hours, till I was heart feared they'd miss us
out o' bed, and raise a cry.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>And you stood two hours in the night listenin' to me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>I 'clare to God, there's somethin' out o' common wi' you or that fiddle,
for I had to stop and listen, and me teeth chatterin' wi' could.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>I did wrong I know, but look here Samuel James, as long as I see that thing
hangin' there, my hands are itchin' to hold it, and the tunes I could
play&mdash;they keep runnin' in my head.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Suddenly rising.</div>

<p>I'll destroy it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Quieting him down.</div>

<p>Na. Na. Its a vallible fiddle.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>It is. Ach man but it does temp' me sorely.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Aye. You might make a fortune, the dear knows. Man I know what <i>I</i> would do
if I could play like <i>you</i> do.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Sarcastically.</div>

<p>That was if ye had the heart.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Excited.</div>

<p>Ach quit! Quit talkin' to me that way. I'm going out.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Goes out by door at back.</div>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Getting off seat and standing about centre of room.</p></div>

<p>He'll take to it yet.</p>

<div class="rightquot">He goes over nearer fireplace.</div>

<p>I can see it workin' in him. Sure his hands are tremblin' and his fingers
twitchin' all the times he's lookin' at it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The grandfather enters softly by door at back. He stands looking at Samuel
James who does not observe him.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Maybe its no' right of me to let it hang there. Ach. He maybe could make
money plenty. I want till have a fine place and a lock o' money. And I'll
build a bigger house.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Hobbling over to his seat.</div>

<p>Aye. Aye. Ye could do a heap wi' money, Samuel James.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Alarmed. He endeavours to bluff it with a show of geniality.</p></div>

<p>Money's the thing, Grand-da.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Its a tarr'ble fine thing, there's no doubt. Food and drink and fine
clothes and fine houses ye can get.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>And tobaccy and seegars and the front seat at a consart.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Here. Don't be temptin' Robbie John about playin' on that fiddle. You've
upset the boy.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Sharply.</div>

<p>I don't temp' him.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>You're always remindin' him of it. I can see what you're workin' for Samuel
James. Ye want all the money for yourself.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Ha' sense, Grand-da. Sure they're settlin' the matter to-day and he's to be
married at Christmas. He wouldn't do anythin' rash now.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>The clock has no' struck the hour yet Samuel James. Ye could no' tell
what's workin' in his mind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Well, he'd be a fool, and what's more, he knows himself to be one if he
goes. He'll lose all the money from Da if he goes, and I'm sure Jennie
Graeme's father wouldn't turn his head to look at a fiddler.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Aye. He's tarr'ble proud o' his family.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Opens door of room and comes in.</div>

<p>Here. I seen Mr. Graeme and your Da comin' up the loney from the windy in
the low room.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Well, they'll be for comin' in here and we're only in the road. Come and
twist a wheen o' ropes for me.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Samuel James and Grandfather go out by door at back.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Takes brush and sweeps floor. She then arranges a kettle at the fire. Then
goes to door and looks out.</p></div>

<p>Aye. Here he bes now and that good man o' mine talkin' till him a dozen
till one. And ten till one, he'll have John Graeme that angered wi' his
arguin', that there'll be nothin' settled the day.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sound of William John Granahan's voice. He appears to be talking at a great
rate and most emphatically.</p>

<p>John Graeme and William John Granahan pass the window.</p></div>

<p>Aye, to be sure. He'd rather get the better o' Graeme in an argyment as
settle wi' him over twenty sons, the ould gomeril.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>John Graeme and William John Granahan enter.</p></div>

<p>How dy'e do, Mr. Graeme?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>She shakes hands with him warmly and warns the husband by nods not to
resume the argument.</p></div>

<p>It's the brave weather for the crops this.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>Indeed we should be deeply thankful for the marcies vouchsafed us.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Solemnly.</div>

<p>Aye indeed.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Well indeed I would be that myself, only the half o' them young chickens
goin' off with the gapes. It was a tarr'ble to do to save what's left o'
them.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Oh well. Its all in the way o' Providence, Mr. Graeme.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>She looks disapprovingly across at Granahan. The two men seat themselves.
John Graeme beside table and Wm. Granahan on edge of table next him.</p></div>

<p>That was a fine lecture on the Temperance ye gied us Mr. Graeme, at
Ballykelly. It done some people a heap o' good.</p>

<div class="rightquot">She looks across meaningly at William Granahan.</div>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Apparently much pleased.</div>

<p>Do you say so, Mrs. Granahan? I'm much pleased indeed to hear o' it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>I only wished more o' the same kind had heerd you.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>She looks across again at William John Granahan who avoids her eye.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>But you'll excuse me, I'm sure. I ha'e some things next room to look after
for the evenin'.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>She curtsies to Graeme and with a warning look at Granahan goes into room.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>I am very much pleased indeed to hear your good woman say she liked what I
said. How did ye take to it yourself, Mr. Granahan?</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Suddenly waking up from twisting and untwisting a piece of string which he
has found and in which he appears deeply interested while his wife is
talking.</p></div>

<p>How did we like the speech you gave on temperance, d'ye say?</p>

<div class="rightquot">Carelessly.</div>

<p>Och, it was a very good and sensible discoorse, so I heerd Ellen and Mrs.
Granahan say.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>Ye didn't go yourself then.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Disappointedly.</div>

<p>Man, I wanted ye there particuler.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>I ha'e no doot if I had been there, I could ha' got up and contradickted
ye, for</p>

<div class="rightquot">Emphatically.</div>

<p>I did not agree wi' all I heerd ye said.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Surprised.</div>

<p>Not agree wi' what I said.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Scornfully with evident disgust.</div>

<p>Man, ye couldn't argy wi' facts. What did ye disagree wi' in the discoorse?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Well for one thing, ye said there was too many public houses in the
country.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Scornfully.</div>

<p>And every right-minded man would agree wi' that.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Well I can shew you another. You'll no argy wi' me that if a man wants to
drink, he will drink.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Somewhat perplexed.</div>

<p>Well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="rightquot">Slowly.</div>

<p>I suppose I do agree till that.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>And if a man will drink, he's boun' till get drunk.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>Na. Na. I don't agree till that.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Triumphantly.</div>

<p>Did you ivir hear tell of a man who was drunk wi'out drinkin'?</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>That's no' in the argyment at all.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>But I tell you it is. A man's bound to be drinkin' if he gets drunk.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>I'm no contradickin' that at all. I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Interrupting.</div>

<p>Now houl' your tongue till I explain till ye. If a man get's drunk when
he's drinkin', he's bound to be drunk o' coorse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Contemptuously.</div>

<p>Ye talk like a child.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Now wait till I get it hammered intill ye. Now when that man's drunk, he's
boun' to ha'e been drinkin'.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He hesitates and is obviously confused. Then suddenly seems to grasp the
idea he wants.</p></div>

<p>Aye&mdash;in a public house o' coorse.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>O' coorse. What else would he do there but drink.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Now that man gets drunk.</p>

<div class="rightquot">He looks inquiringly at Graeme</div>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Hopelessly.</div>

<p>Aye.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Now the public houses are that scarce that he has till walk home maybe ten
mile or more.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>Well?</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>And ten till wan he gets lost or somethin', and they have the whole
countryside upset lookin' for him. Now if he had a public house convanient
in his own townland, there would be no bother at all, and he could be at
his work the next mornin' wi'out any interruptin' o' labour. D'ye see what
I mane?</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Suddenly appearing at door evidently angry.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>The more public houses the less drinkin' did he say? If he had <i>his</i> way o'
it, every other house from here to Buckna would be a public house.</p>

<div class="rightquot">To husband.</div>

<p>Quit your wastin' Mr. Graeme's time wi' your argyments, and settle what he
has come here to do wi' ye.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Well. Well. We'll agree till let the matter drop. You ha'e nobody but your
daughter I suppose?</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>Well I ha'e a sister married up in Dublin.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>But she's in a good way o' doin' I suppose?</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>Oh yes. Purty fair. O' coorse I would like to lave her somethin'.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Ach, gi'e her a lock o' your hair or somethin'. You'll lave the place to
your daughter o' coorse.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>Yes. I'll be doin' that.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Aye. It's a purty fair farm o' land. Ye bought it out o' coorse?</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>Two year come March, and a good reduction.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Aye. So I heerd. Well if ye gi'e her the farm and what money ye ha'e, I'll
gi'e Robbie a cheque for a hunnert poun'.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Impressively.</div>

<p>William John Granahan d'ye think this is a horse fair? My daughter will
ha'e no man unner five hunnert poun'.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Uneasily and walking about.</div>

<p>Man, you'll nivir get her married John Graeme, at that way o' talkin'. Five
hunnert poun'. D'ye think I'm a Rockyfellow? Ha'e some sense about ye.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>Aither that or no son o' yours weds my daughter. Five hunnert poun' and not
one ha'penny less. There's the family name to be thought o'.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Ach! family name! a lock o' ould wives' blathers about who was married till
who, till you'd have your head sore takin' it all in.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>You've heerd what I ha'e to say. Take it or lave it. You can plaze
yourself.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Five hunnert poun'. It's a tarr'ble price. Would two hunnert no' do? You
see I ha'e Samuel James and Ellen to provide for.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>A Graeme o' Killainey weds no man unner five hunnert poun', William
Granahan. Mind that. I want my daughter married to no beggarman.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Excitedly.</div>

<p>Beggarman! Beggarman, did ye say? Hats, John Graeme, I think ye should be proud o' wan o' yours
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
marryin' a Granahan. Money or no money, that's a nice way o' talkin'.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>I suppose ye know I come o' good family, Mr. Granahan?</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Sarcastically.</div>

<p>I heard ye were wance cotter folk up by Dromara mountain.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Proudly.</div>

<p>My father and my forefathers had my farm&mdash;aye, from the time o' the
plantin'.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>D'ye tell me? I nivir seen your laase o' the farm but of coorse if ye say
so. Did ye nivir hear tell of Smith, Hunter, and Fargison?</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Contemptuously.</div>

<p>John Smith of Ballykelly?</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Disgusted.</div>

<p>Yon cratur? Ballykelly?</p>

<div class="rightquot">Proudly.</div>

<p>Lonnon! Well my mother was a daughter o' Samuel James Smith, and a niece o'
Robert John Francis Fargison.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Contemptuously.</div>

<p>I nivir heerd tell o' them.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>I wonner at your ignorance John Grame. A well educated
man like yourself as sets yourself up to be taching
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the congregation on matters o' law and the temperance question, (<i>raising
voice</i>) and you that ignorant o' common information.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Opening door and coming in a few steps.</div>

<p>William John Granahan, didn't I tell ye not to be raisin' argyments. How
you manage at the markets I nivir could understand. Get your business done,
and ha' settled wi' it.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Soothingly.</div>

<p>Whist, whist woman, I was only discoorsin'. Mind the tay and I'll mind the
rest. There. There. I agree to your tarms, John Graeme. I'll do it, though
it's lavin' me tarr'ble short.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Impressively.</div>

<p>But there's one thing I'll no ha'e, William Granahan.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Alarmed.</div>

<p>And what might that be?</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>If your son is to marry my daughter, I'll ha'e none o' his music. Its all
very well for quality and the like to go strummin' on instruments, but its
no' meant for a sensible farmer.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Aye. I agree wi' that. But look here. Mind ye a song or two and a bit o' a
tune on a long winter's night keeps one from thinkin' long and between you
and me, it keeps you from the bottle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>That's where you and I differs. Supposin' he starts playin' a dance tune or
two, and the neighbours gather in. You like to do the thing dacint, and ye
send out for drink, and then it goes from bad to worse. Na. Na. I'll ha'e
none o' that.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Well. Well. Make your mind aisy. Ye know he has promised me nivir to play
again, and I don't think you'll hear much o' his fiddlin'.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>I'm right glad to hear it, and I'll tak' your word for it.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Very good.</p>

<div class="rightquot">With admiration.</div>

<p>Man, you'd ha' made a great horsedailer John Graeme.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>Aye. I had an uncle in the town, a dailer, and he was always sayin' that.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>And well you could ha' done it, if I knowed anythin'. I'll go to Banbridge
a Friday wi' you to settle wi' the lawyers.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>Very good. I'll call for you wi' the trap that day. Its time I was for
goin' home.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>We were expectin' ye ower the day, and I think Mrs. Granahan has the tay
laid in the low room.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Calls.</div>

<p>Mrs. Granahan!</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">From room.</div>

<p>Yes.</p>

<div class="rightquot">She comes in and stands waiting near door.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>We're just after settlin' up about Robbie John and Jennie. Can ye get us a
drop o' tay?</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>If you could just take Mr. Graeme for a turn round, I could ha'e it for you
in wan second. The table's laid and the kettle's boilin'. Is your daughter
wi' you Mr. Graeme?</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>Aye. She was comin' over after me. I suppose she should be here by now.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>Well I can show you the new reaper and binder I got. That new Wexford
machine, I was tellin' you about a Sunday in the Session.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>Very good. I'll just go out and see it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>William John Granahan and John Graeme go out by door at back.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Going over to fire and arranging kettle.</div>

<p>Five hunnert poun, and after me tellin' him to keep till four hunnert. Wait
till I get ahoult o' him again. I'll speak till him. Did he no' hear me
thumpin' four times on the door till remind him. He must ha'e a soft spot
in his heart for Robbie John.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Tap at door.</div>

<p>Come in.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Jane Graeme enters somewhat diffidently.</div>

<p>Oh its you Miss Graeme.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Shakes hands.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Youre welcome indeed. Your father's just gone out wi' my good man.</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>Yes. I know&mdash;but I thought perhaps&mdash;well that Robbie was in here.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Inspecting her critically.</div>

<p>Deed now, I couldn't tell you where he might be.</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>I'll just sit down a minute. I suppose you are all doing well here Mrs.
Granahan?</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Ach aye. As well as one could expeck. There's nothin' to make much
complaint o'.</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>I haven't seen Robbie about for some time Mrs. Granahan. I suppose he's
working hard at the harvest.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Aye 'deed there's a brave press o' work on now, what wi' the corn a
cuttin', and the rest o' it, he's been gey busy o' late.</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>Indeed I am sure he was.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>She looks round, sees the fiddle hanging up where Taylor has left it.</p></div>

<div class="rightquot">Aside.</div>

<p>Is that the fiddle he was telling me about, I wonder?</p>

<div class="rightquot">To Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Is that the tramp's fiddle, Mrs. Granahan?</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Aye, that's the poor cratur's belongin'. But you needn't be afeared.
Robbie's indeed been very good. He's nivir played on it to my knowin', and
keeps his promise well.</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>Poor Robbie. Do you not think he's unhappy about something or other Mrs.
Granahan. He's got very dull and moody this last while.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Deed now I don't see much odds in him Miss Graeme. He nivir was a great boy
with his tongue anyway;</p>

<div class="rightquot">Slily.</div>

<p>bar maybe an odd wan or two he would mak' up to.</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>I think you do wrong to keep that fiddle hanging up before his eyes, when
he has promised never to play again.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Och blatherations. I nivir heerd the like o' the sort o' talk people goes
on wi' nowadays. Do ye think my son bes only an ould ba cryin' for a toy?
Deed now I don't think he worries his-self much about it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Aside.</div>

<p>Poor Robbie.</p>

<div class="rightquot">To Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Robbie's a poor hand at the farming, Mrs. Granahan.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Snappishly.</div>

<p>Och aye. But he's greatly mended since he giv up playin'.</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>Yes. He's a very poor farmer. But he was a wonder with his fiddle.</p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Oh well. It canna' be helped. He's better wi'out.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>I don't know.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>She goes over and takes down the fiddle seats herself and draws the bow
across it as it lies on her lap.</p></div>

<p>Robbie could have made it speak to you. He used to make me cry, and then
laugh after it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>She places the strings near her ear and thumbs it wrapt in thought.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Looking contemptuously at her and then rising.</div>

<p>You just stay here a second till I fix the tay.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>She goes into room. Jane remains seated where she is, occasionally touching
the strings and seemingly deep in thought. Robbie John passes window. He
looks in and then goes quickly to door and enters.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Who's that fiddlin'?</p>

<div class="rightquot">Goes over to Jane.</div>

<p>Why it's you. I heard you were come.</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>Yes. I'm just in a minute or two.</p>

<div class="rightquot">He sits down beside her.</div>

<p>Robbie.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Well?</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>Answer me one question. Aren't you a very poor farmer?</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Well&mdash;I&mdash;I suppose I am.</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>I knew you were. You're no good for selling cattle or going to market, or
looking after crops.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>You're very hard Jane to-night. What's put all that into your wee head?</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>I've been listening to this and its been tellin' stories on you.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Aye and when its hangin' there dumb its speakin' to me, callin' to me.
Don't think I'm mad Jane but I can't stand it much longer. What makes them
hang it there to temp' me? Why? Just because they think they can make a few
miserable pounds, they'll keep it there makin' me a liar, a pledge breaker,
a man who can't keep his promise. I'll end it now. I'll smash it.</p>

<div class="rightquot">He makes to take the fiddle out of her hands.</div>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Resisting.</div>

<p>No. No. I want to say&mdash;I want to ask something Robbie. What does it
say to you?</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>What does it&mdash;Ach&mdash;I wonder would you laugh at me like the rest
if I told you.</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Sitting closer and putting her arm about his neck.</div>

<p>What does it say. Tell me. <i>I</i> would never laugh at you Robbie dear.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Hesitatingly.</div>

<p>Ach&mdash;about&mdash;about takin' it and makin' a name for myself with it.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Bitterly.</div>

<p>It sounds like fool talk doesn't it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>To my father and yours it would sound like that and Samuel James would
laugh at you, but he'd encourage you to believe in it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Let me break it then. Smash it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Determinedly.</div>

<p>No. Look Robbie if I said it was whispering you the truth, what would you
say?</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Surprised.</div>

<p>I would say that it was true. But you never would.</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Determinedly.</div>

<p>I say it is the truth.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>You what? Ach you don't know what you say child. If I did take to it again,
look what would happen. My father would turn me out, and your father would
forbid me then ever lookin' at you again. Jane Graeme engaged to a
penniless fiddler, and she the best match in the whole countryside. I need
never think of you again Jane.</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>I don't care what they bid. If you took to that fiddle and went away, would
you forget me soon?</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>Forget you, Jane? What makes you think that? Sure you know I gave it up
sooner than lose you.</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>Then take that fiddle and do what your heart tells you to.
I wondered often and often what it was that made you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
so sad, and I know now. God made you a musician and not a farmer.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>And you? What would you do?</p>

<div class="pchar">Jane.</div>

<p>I know and trust some day God willing, you'll come back to me, rich and
famous enough to have them all at your feet. I know you will.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>God bless you wee girl for you're put a heart into me.</p>

<div class="rightquot">They embrace. Mrs. Granahan comes in.</div>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>There. There. Bide a wee. Here they're all coming in for their tays.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>William John Granahan, Graeme, Taylor, Samuel James and Grandfather come
in. Robbie John goes over to fiddle and puts it into a case.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Puzzled.</div>

<p>So you're at it again, are you? Well I suppose there's no harm in giving
Miss Graeme a tune, but I thought you were a man to your word.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Determinedly.</div>

<p>Look here. I want you all to know I am goin' to try my luck with this.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Exultingly.</div>

<p>You're goin' to lave us like to mak' money wi' it.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>I'm goin' to try.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Mrs. Granahan.</div>

<p>Robbie John are you daft. What wild nonsense are ye talkin' about. And you
to be married at Christmas and everythin' settled about you this very day.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>I am determined to do it. Nothin' can keep me back.</p>

<div class="pchar">John Graeme.</div>

<p>There. That's enough. My daughter jilted by a Granahan! Come home out o'
this Jane Graeme.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He stamps his foot angrily and beckons her to come. Jane moves past Robbie
John where he is standing and then suddenly kisses him and goes out with
her father.</p></div>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="centerquot">Passionately.</div>

<p>You see what you ha'e done Robert John Granahan. Broken your parents'
hearts, and made the name of the Granahans a disgrace to the countryside.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Wildly.</div>

<p>Quick d&mdash;n ye before it's too late.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>My mind's made up. Give me the address of that Professor you told me of,
Mr. Taylor.</p>

<div class="pchar">Taylor.</div>

<p>You're a fool, Robbie.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Producing card and handing it to him.</div>

<p>There. That's it.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>There's time yet, man. After John Graeme, and make it up wi' him. Swear you
were only makin' fun.</p>

<div class="pchar">Robbie John.</div>

<p>I stick by the fiddle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Mad with anger.</div>

<p>Then stick by the fiddle. And know if ever you are weary or ahungered or in
want, ye need nivir look me for any help.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Shouts.</div>

<p>Out you go. Out. Don't dar one of you as much as till take his hand. Out.
Out the same as the beggar man gone, wi' the curse of your father on you.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Robbie John goes toward back and stands a moment as if in silent appeal at
the open door. Mrs. Granahan rushes forward to her husband as if to entreat
mercy. He angrily puts her away.</p></div>

<p>Out. Out you go.</p>

<h2><a name="EPILOGUE" id="EPILOGUE"></a>EPILOGUE.</h2>


<p><small>The same scene, about midnight. There is no light except that of one or two
candles and the turf fire. Grandfather seated at fire. William John
Granahan leaning despondently on table beside which he is seated. Samuel
James in his favourite seat on the top of the table. Wind, storm and rain
outside.</small></p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Aye. Aye. But its no use talkin' now. Ye might ha' been a wee bit the less
hasty.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<p>And who was goin' to thole yon conduck. It was too bad of him and after the
to-do we had over him this very day. Its a sore heartscald, Robbie John,
ye've been to me this day.</p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>Ach, sure its over. Its full time we were in our beds.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Viciously.</div>

<p>You'd think he was dead and buried to hear the two of ye goin' on. Sure for
all know, he may be comin' back and a great name wi' him.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>That's you to the ground, ye cunnin' rascal. Keep him out at all costs.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Thunder and lightning.</div>

<p>D'ye hear yon? To think o' that poor sowl wi' his wee bit o' a coat out in
the coul' and wet. If any harm come till him, Samuel James, know this, you
were the cause o' it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<div class="pchar">Samuel James.</div>

<p>It was his own choosin'.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>His own choosin'. Who flattered him and led him on? Who kep' the fiddle
hangin' there and would let no one take it down, a continuin' temptation
till him? And you, William John Granahan, wi' your lust for money. Aye.
Lust for money. You couldn't abide him heartenin' up the house wi' a tune
or two, but ye'd brak the boy's heart sendin' him out till work again, and
him workin' as much as two of Samuel James there. Ye thought he was wastin'
time and money. D'ye think there's nothin' in this life beyond making money
above the rent. I tell you it's not the money alone that makes life worth
livin'. It's the wee things you think nothin' o', but that make your home a
joy to come back till, after a hard day's work. And you've sent out into
the coul and wet, the one that was makin' your home somethin' more than the
common. D'ye think them proud city folk will listen to his poor ould
ballads wi' the heart o' the boy singin' through them. Its only
us&mdash;its only us, I say, as knows the long wild nights, and the wet and
the rain and the mist o' nights on the boglands,&mdash;its only us I say,
could listen him in the right way,</p>

<div class="rightquot">Sobbing.</div>

<p>and ye knowed, right well ye knowed, that every string o' his fiddle was
kayed to the cryin' o' your own heart.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Half sobbing.</div>

<p>There. There. God forgive me, my poor ould boy. I
did na know. Whist. Maybe if I say a word or two:&mdash;Oh
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
God forgive us this night our angry words, and ha'e marcy on my wayward
son, O Lord, and keep him safe from harm, and deliver him not unto the
adversary. Amen.</p>

<div class="pchar">Grandfather.</div>

<p>Amen. Aye. Aye. Ye done well. Let no the sun go down upon your wrath.</p>

<div class="pchar">William John Granahan.</div>

<div class="rightquot">Going to door.</div>

<p>It's a coorse night.</p>

<div class="rightquot">Pauses.</div>

<p>I'll lave the door on the hesp.</p>

<h2><i>PRESS OPINIONS OF PERFORMANCES.</i></h2>


<p>"The Turn of the Road" ... is beyond question one of the most sterling
products of the Irish literary revival ever seen at the Abbey Theatre.
Whether depicting a matchmaker like the astute Mrs. Granahan ... or
reproducing the conversation of farmers just returned from fair or market,
discussing parish affairs or speculating on harvest prospects, the author
is equally delightful and successful.&mdash;<i>Irish Times.</i></p>

<p>The "Turn of the Road" ... is one of the most successful pieces ever
written dealing with Irish life. The author "Rutherford Mayne" has drawn
his characters with a master's hand and they stand out clear and
distinct.&mdash;<i>Freeman's Journal.</i></p>

<p>The play was of engrossing interest and was a masterpiece of composition
which speaks hopefully of the work to be expected of the Ulster School of
Drama.&mdash;<i>Daily Express.</i></p>

<p>"The Turn of the Road" is a brilliantly written comedy characteristic of
the County of Down.&mdash;<i>Irish Independent.</i></p>

<p>The charm of this little play is delightful and natural; its comedy is
beautifully balanced and its pathos ... superb and admirably
restrained.&mdash;<i>Evening Herald.</i></p>

<p>"The Turn of the Road" is a clever and poetic conception clothed in smart
effective County Down dialogue with many bright and sparkling lines. The
significance, the pathos, and inherent beauty of the concluding scene is a
piece of consummate art.&mdash;<i>Belfast Newsletter.</i></p>

<p>The author ... builds his scenes out of simple materials but always with
the eye of a craftsman for striking effects and incidents.... The "Return
from Market," "The Marriage Bargain," and the last scene ... have the
illusion of life, and are in a phrase&mdash;which, though blunted by
misuse, expresses a real need in Irish Art&mdash;"racy of the
soil"&mdash;<i>The Northern Whig.</i></p>

<p>"The Turn of the Road" is a cleverly constructed picture of life in a
County Down farmhouse, evidently drawn by one who knew his characters or
their prototypes in the flesh.&mdash;<i>Irish News.</i></p>

<p>It is a play that transports the hedge rows, the farm kitchen with its
dresser and turf fire, and above all the real vernacular right into our
preception more vividly than an experience. The author has written a
remarkable fine play of life, humour, and realism.&mdash;<i>Nomad's Weekly
and Belfast Critic.</i></p>

<p>Into the brief compass of his two acts Mr. Rutherford Mayne has compressed
the age-long attitude of Ulster towards the arts.... Light is breaking
after the long Arctic night. The very existence of this poignant play
pregnantly indicates that the old order is changing and must soon give
place to the new.&mdash;<i>The Lady of the House.</i></p>

<p>The more we see this peasant drama in two scenes and an epilogue, the more
we admire its unpretending art and its real greatness.&mdash;<i>Belfast
Evening Telegraph.</i></p>
